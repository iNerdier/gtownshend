My personal work is image based and specifically photographic. I enjoy working with obsolete or eccentric technology and am currently  repurposing old film equipment to be used in new ways, including modifying medium format cameras to shoot instant film.

I shoot with both digital and film, with an emphasis on film for personal work due to the posibilities of altering the process. Cameras used range from sub-miniature to large format as well as cine.

Current work-in progress projects include documenting the empty 'luxury' tower blocks in London, the remains of WWII defences left on the British coast line and a series of portraits.
