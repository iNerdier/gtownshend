### About

With a few exceptions all work is shot on film and developed by me (yes, even the C41 & E6 stuff). I've shot sub-miniature to large format and everything in-between.

My personal work is mostly photographic image based though I do also occasionally branch out into origami and a few other creative things. I enjoy working with obsolete or eccentric technology and am currently  repurposing old film equipment to be used in new ways, including modifying medium format cameras to shoot instant film.

Currently hoping to get on an MA programme in Autumn of 2019 further develop my practice.

I studied graphic design, did some web development for a bit, worked doing restoration of artworks and still sell things at a farmers market at the weekends.

### Projects

Up-coming project for my new-to-me large format camera, documenting the empty ‘luxury’ tower blocks in London. Current projects include documenting the remains of things left on the British coast line and a series of portraits.

Completely unrelated to photography I'm also attempting to learn how to weld.
