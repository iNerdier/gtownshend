### About

I take photographs, mostly with film cameras. 

I never stopped or came back to it, it's just always been a thing I did. I learned to use and print from film when my mother showed me as a child and I inherited a few film cameras. It just seemed like the right thing to use them again.

I studied graphic design at Camberwell College of Art, didn't enjoy it at all and then made a few very simple websites for people after graduating. Then I decided I didn't like being in front of a computer all day and was not at all good at finding clients. Then I worked on a couple of tv shoots as a camera assistant and ended up selling apple juice at a farmers market for years. Then I did another, much better fine art foundation at the City Lit and started enjoying making things again.

### Process

I wish that I could actually tell you. I have a great respect for those photographers who have a whole methodology and understanding of their methods, I try and find interesting objects / people / buildings and frame them in as best a way as I can. Sometimes it works, often I wish I had done something differently.

For 2020 my plan is to take a thoughtful photograph every day and post the results on the web.

Mainly because I can't afford to do otherwise I develop everything myself (including colour). I probably ruin about a third of what I shoot due to keeping chemicals too long or using expired film that seemed like a good idea on ebay. I also take cameras apart for much the same reason and have a pretty good success rate fixing them.
