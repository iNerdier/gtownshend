### About

My personal work is image based and specifically photographic. I enjoy working with obsolete or eccentric technology and am currently  repurposing old film equipment to be used in new ways, including modifying medium format cameras to shoot instant film.

I shoot with both digital and film, with an emphasis on film for personal work for reasons I don't think I fully understand myself. Cameras used range from sub-miniature to large format as well as occasionally cine.

### Projects


Up-coming project for my new-to-me large format camera, documenting the empty ‘luxury’ tower blocks in London. Current projects include documenting the remains of things left on the British coast line and a series of portraits.
