### About

I am a photographer and photographic artist from London, currently on the Masters program at the University of Brighton.

Much of my work involves ‘alt-process’ printing, usually cyanotype and argyrotype. 

My background is in graphic and web design though I never worked professionally in either for very long
 
Aside from still image making I have also worked in TV as a camera assistant and currently am working on short film ideas. I also have an interest in interactive art and artworks made with light.

Where possible I like to be practical and learn new skills, be they in music, electronics or programming. I enjoy taking apart machinery to see how it works and I repair and build my own cameras.

I've done a lot of life drawing and spent probably too much time trying to understand how computers work.

### Process

Most of the images I take at the moment are with film cameras. Though it's really more about the image than the technique, part of the enjoyment I have found with doing so physical nature of working with film and paper. The tactile quality of handling everything is something I find energising and having limitations forced on my by choices of film stock often lead to more thoughtful results.

In the past however I have taken a photograph of myself every day for six years (digitally) despite not enjoying having images taken of myself.

Some of my latest work experiments have involved both my interests in origami and photography. I have been folding light sensitive paper and projecting images onto it to create three dimensional prints.

In part because of the nature of photographic paper being either resin or baryta coated and therefore rather difficult to fold (especially in the dark), this has drawn me towards alternative and more tolerant photographic processes such as cyanotype and argyrotype as well as coating my own pre-creased paper with photographic emulsion.

My practice is still very much in a state of development. While much of what I do has been self taught through trial and error, though the more I do the more I learn about what fits my working patterns. I really thrive when there are people I can ask questions of and learn from, much of the improvement and change has come when I have found likeminded people to work alongside.

### Influences

As is often the best way, the people who have most influenced me are from disparate artistic backgrounds. I try to keep and open mind where possible and to seek out as many different influences as possible.

Here are some of the more immediately memorable:

I very much admire the work of *Bridget Riley*, *Giovanni Battista Piranesi* and *M.C. Escher* for their mathematical elegance in design and the artworks they produce(d).

*Robert J. Lang*, *Eric Gjerde* and *Peter Callesen* for their amazing work on origami and paper sculpture.

The Sculptural work of *Alexander Calder*, *Takis* and *Donald Judd* which showed me that sculpture could move and feel like more than just and object to be reverent of.

The opulence and elegance of the Vienna secessionist movement, as typified by *Gustav Klimt* and *Egon Schiele*. Schiele made me appreciate the angles of human form; *John Coplans* and *Benoit Courti* showed me how photography could show humans in ways I had never considered.

Surrealism in *Georgio de Chirico*, *Max Ernst* and *René Magritte*. Appreciating the weird, the humour in art as well as just how much personal perception shapes artistic expression.

*Dan Flavin*, *James Turrell* and *Fischli & Weiss* amazed for their installations based on light alone and how much a space can be shaped by changing what you get to see of it.

*Issey Miyake*, *Aitor Throup*, *Gareth Pugh* and *Lee McQueen* opened my eyes to just how experimental and wonderful fashion can be, despite the haze and weirdness that surrounds it all.

The music of *Bach*, thanks to my grandmother who is and always has been a true devotee of classical music.

I was introduced to the masters of 20th century photography as so many are via *Ansel Adams*, *Henri Cartier-Bresson* and *Lee Miller*. I got excited by less famous people like *Frank Habicht* and *Akihiko Okamura* who showed me both about cultural revolution and the strife in conflict.

As for those living and currently making work those influences seem to change all the time. Some of the people I have been enjoying lately include:

* *[Chloe Dewe Mathews](http://www.chloedewemathews.com)* work about the Caspian
* *[Ralph Whitehead](http://www.ralphwhitehead.com)’s* large format paper negative fashion work
* *[Kevin Mason](https://www.kevin-mason.com)’s* portraiture
* *[Mark Webber](https://www.markdwebber.com)* and *[Patrick Joust](https://www.patrickjoust.com)’s* work both involving suburban USA devoid of people at night.
* *[Brendan Barry](http://brendanbarry.co.uk)* and his work turning rooms into cameras.
