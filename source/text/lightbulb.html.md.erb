Birdhouse in your Soul, They Might Be Giants, Flood, 1990

When I studied graphic design there was a tutor at university who was a photographer. Quite why she taught on the graphic design course was never clear to me, I think she did eventually get moved over. What I remember however, was that she was entirely against the idea of using artificial light in any of her work.

I always thought this was a strange thing to say as a photographer. To me at least, it always felt as though the source of light was really not the important part, what mattered is what you did with it.
